# Uncursed C++ Library

The Uncursed library is a C++ wrapper for PDCurses/NCurses, to make using them less awkward and generally awful. There isn't much by way of documentation right now; this is primarily code I use in my own personal projects, but I'm releasing it here in case it's any use to anyone.

[NCurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) Copyright (c) 1998-2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

[PDCurses](https://pdcurses.org/) is a public-domain implementation of X/Open Curses, maintainted by William McBrine.
